                I was recently a GIS Researcher for Apple as a contractor. In
                this role, I began analyzing aerial imagery to highlight changes
                to the mapped network. Due to my success, I took more of a QA
                role, checking other researchers' work. In this role, I
                developed my cross-functional skills as I communicated
                information among multiple teams. I developed my analytics
                skills as this position was heavily reliant on metrics.
                Priorities change frequently in the tech industry and I can
                adapt and focus my attention on the projects that needed to be
                completed.

              <p>
                As a Tax Operations Intern for Oracle, I had a key role in the
                source to settle business process as I helped manage suppliers
                with registering, contracting, purchasing and payment. With this
                role, I developed my data analysis skills. I used Excel and
                Oracle Business Intelligence tools to help suppliers with the
                creation of services and payments to ensure Tax and Treasury
                services for Oracle. Here I gained experience in Project
                Management as I routinely manage status update meetings to other
                analysts, managers, and suppliers. I managed trackers to ensure
                projects are completed. I performed metric updates to ensure our
                department was on track with tax managers' service requests and
                our suppliers received payments promptly.
